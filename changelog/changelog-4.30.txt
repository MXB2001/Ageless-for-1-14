- TRASCEDENT AURA REWORK
It now works more similar to Decay, as previous way was causing way too weird ressults in testing.
1) Now magic ressistances upgrades are cumulative and could potentially go higher than 0%
2) Now all physic ressistances do correctly get lowered by -20% correctly, same as if affected by enemy decay.
3) Now decreases cold ressistance by -10%
--- Indirectly, Asperser & Inquisitor ingame ressistances from -20% to 0%.
Idea is that trascendent aura substracts more than what it adds, being situational. Gives 50% in ressists and -70% in weaknesses.

EFM - DARKLANDERS
AMLA XP that are lower than 100 adjusted to 120
(Beastskull intentionally requires 1 AMLA to then gain strikes becuase of powerful berserker)
(Serpent won't as well because why it has to deal high damages? it gained lv2 massive damage buff to not get murdered by lv1 serkers)

They enjoy of great mobility, but their melee was underperforming.
