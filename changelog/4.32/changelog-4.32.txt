AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
- This update is to adjust arcane ressistance to many human/humanoid factions to 10% , as it will be the new base value for them in 1.18
- There are minor balance changes in other random stuff.

Few cases are left unchanged, as they will automatically become to 10% arcane value as soon as we get wesnoth 1.18.

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Certain HORSE units adjusting manually to 20% (personal criteria of mine)
Horse is not very popular or loved by players, they require more skill to work because of 40% defense cap and -20% on pierce.
- EE Outlaw Witches will become 20% arcane res in 1.18 , maintaining them constant after 1.18 release.
- Review in 1.18 EFM factions to adjust/modify arcane ressistance if needed.

THIS LIST WILL ALSO INCLUDE changes done in days 20 and 21th of January of 2024 and previous ones
- Making Secret attack types be bit more common , as well of units resistant to it (to force map/scenarios authors to take this attack type more in consideration)
