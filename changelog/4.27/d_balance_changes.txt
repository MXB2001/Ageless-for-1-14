Imperial - Sidhe
Didn't think that this faction could cause a lot of havoc , specially at competitive RPG / Afterlife gameplay with the addition of XP
mod. It's blatant that some of their units can be abused from their actual stats to do insane amount of damage or just to be 
exceptional tanks with almost no counter at all.

Hoarfroster
 - Frost Wind damage adjusted from 3-7 to 4-5
 
Snowdancer
 - Frost wind damage adjusted from 4-8 to 5-6

Blizzard Lord
 - Frost Wind damage from 5-9 to 7-6
 - Cold resistance from 20% to 30%
 
Thunderblade 
 - Sword damage from 9-5 to 8-5
 
Tracker
 - Spear (mele) damage from 6-3 to 5-3
Preventing this unit being abusive 9-3 + poison at night if strong trait.

Windrunner
 - Spear (mele) damage from 9-3 to 8-3
 
Warrior Spirit
This unit is extremely unfair for other players at both games creepwars and afterlife, at having no drainer handicap and to scale too good
with extra health points. At having magical on lv2 and lv3 ... certain things will be nerfed at here. 
 - Health from 20 to 24
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -40%
 - Physical resistances from 50% to 40%
 - Fire resistance from 10% to 0%
 - Cold resistance from 70% to 65%
 - XP from 30 to 45
 
A flat -55% resistance nerf between the 6 attack types.
Fair point of floating swords is that they don't get ranged until lv4 and they're 40% defense at most common terrains.


Ancestor
 - Health from 28 to 33
 - Regenerates changed to Selfheal(6)
 - Requiem's +Magical changed to +Enchanted (always 70% --> 60%)
 - Physical resistances from 50% to 40%
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -40%
 - Fire resistance from 10% to 0%
 - Cold resistance from 70% to 65%
 - XP from 80 to 85
 - Price from 44g to 42g
 
I just completely disagree at over-rewarding people that only knows any unit in an existing era. Decreasing the advantage at knowing
specific units that are simply too difficult to be countered for certain factions.
 

Forefather
 - Health from 40 to 48
 - Regenerates changed to Selfheal(6)
 - Requiem's +Magical changed to +Enchanted (always 70% --> 60%)

RE Ships
Considered that all these ships are akward to use except the elvish boat, but all of them will be buffed considering their obstinant
movetype, specially the larger ships that actually are terrible at being forced to have maximun terrain defense of 40%


movement_type=AE_RHY_ship
 - Castle movement cost from 5 to 3
 - Castle defense from 10% to 20%

These changes to Ships ARE NOT PRESENT in the sent file, but it's a proposal to make them somewhat more viable in maps like orocia.
As well making them somewhat more smooth to use.
Sometimes, realism has huge consecuences at gameplay, this time will focus more on gameplay over realism.

RE - Dwarves
Apreciable buff to Dwarvish Scorpio/Ballistas while adjusting dwarven spirits to a more similar context as of floating swords.


Dwavish Scorpio
Idea is simple, giving a bonus mele attack, an always 1 strike one that has counter (so it won't be instantly deleted by zerkers)
Also increasing the amount of situations this unit can really work well
 - Health from 60 to 66
 - New Attack: Ballista 13-1 +defend-only +first-strike +counter [+UNUPGRADABLE(1) not yet implemented]
 - Hidden Attack: Old 25-1 (-10% accuracy) attack will not be showed? considering about removing the attack? "range" doesn't work
                  and cannot be used by AI at all.
 - Ballista (ranged) will now have +Counter (at least 60% in retaliation)
 - Arcane resistance from 50% to 60%
 - Cold resistance from 10% to 15%
 - Fire resistance from -40% to -50%
 - Blade resistance from 0% to 10%

 - Pierce resistance from 40% to 45%
 - XP from 160 to 136
 - Price from 53g to 55g
 - Role adjusted to archer (from fighter)
It will not be defeated by lv1 berserkers now.


Dwarvish Ballista 
 - Health from 75 to 88
 - New Attack: Ballista 19-1 +defend-only +first-strike +revenge [+UNUPGRADABLE(1) not yet implemented]
 - Hidden Attack: Old 35-1 (-10% accuracy) attack will not be showed? considering about removing the attack? "range" doesn't work
                  and cannot be used by AI at all.
 - Ballista will now have +Aimed (50% masrskman) and +Counter (at least 60% chance to hit on retaliation)

 - Cold resistance from 10% to 15%
 - Fire resistance from -40% to -50%
 - Blade resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Impact resistance from 10% to 15%
 - Pierce resistance from 40% to 45%
 - Price from 63g to 72g
 - Role adjusted to archer (from fighter)

 - Physical resistances from 50% to 55%
 - Arcane resistance from -10% to -30%
 - Fire resistance from 10% to 15%

 ---> All terrain defenses will be lowered to 40% (except these that will be marked to 50%)
      - Castle defense lowered to 45% (undecited if 40% or 50% were more fair, so I left to 45%)
      All other terrains will be adjusted 50% [hills/mountains/caves]
 - XP from 33 to 43

ELE - Centaurs
All Eternity Era units will be nerfed because their balance was blatantly done to be above default standards (thing that 
the era's author was advised that Ageless would gradually be more default-like balance... and that I was personally not agree
with his "it's ageless, they can be op lol")

At least, can say that of all of ELE's faction this one is actually the least OP.


Angelician XP from 36 to 43

Arch Priestess
 - Health from 35 to 44 (did not gain any extra HP at leveling before)
 - Light sparks damage from 4-6 to 5-6
 - {AE_ELE_WEAPON_SPECIAL_HOLY} will now affect bonus damage from 50% to 20% againist undead.
   Such special that gives extra damage againist specific enemies is unfair for the other side units. Specially if given upgrades to dmg.
 - Price from 42g to 48g

Archer's XP from 40 to 44
Actually a very cost efficient archer. Lacking limitations of movilty by just 2 more gold and optional 60% def at forest.

Fighter
 - Sword damage from 5-3 to 6-3
 - XP from 33 to 40

Warrior XP from 60 to 67

Spear Fighter XP from 60 to 72
Helpful auras units usually demand more XP to be adquired.

Centaur Captain's spear (ranged) damage from 9-2 to 8-2
It's a +20% damage aura unit that has nothing else than 60 HP and 7 movement and quite decent mele, pretty much useful.

Patrol XP from 36 to 39

Chaser
 - Chain (ranged) damage from 7-2 to 6-2
 - XP from 60 to 72
 - Price from 29g to 32g
 
Retreiver
Likely slow at both mele and ranged isn't enough OP... lol
 - Chain Whip damage from 12-3 to 11-3 and no longer has +First-strike
 - Leather Whip damage from 8-3 to 5-3

Pegasus 
 - Spear (arcane) will now have +First-Strike (will help at certain countering to Skeletical Spear fighter)
 - XP from 40 to 43
(giving +First-strike to an attack that can only be used offensively isn't a notisable bonus, but helps againist a specific unit that
 is present in its corresponding era)
 
Centinel
 - Spear (arcane) will now have +First-strike
 - XP from 70 to 80
 
 
Centaur Guardian
Bugged resistances (lower than of lv2?) and missing marskman on divine spear, basically bugged in it's purpose.
 - Health from 72 to 64
 - Divine Spear will now have +Marskman +First-strike (it used to not have lv2's marskman lol)
 - Shield damage from 11-3 to 8-4
 - Javeline damage from 9-2 to 6-3
 - Blade resistance from -10% to 0% (no longer bugged, but nerfed if ghype has applied correctly the resistances lol)
 - Impact resistance from -20% to 20%
 - Switched fire resistance from 10% to cold 10%
 - Pierce resistance from 0% to -10% (fixed the bugged resistances at impact/blade, seems fine nerfing pierce lol)
 - Price from 53g to 55g
 ----- Decided to add more strikes but lowering damages at the other 2 attacks in order to make the unit scale worse with extra strikes
       if used in XP mod. Decreasing reward of giving extra strikes in this unit.
 I'm not changing this unit before testing it or viewing others testing it.
 
 
Divine
 - Divine Spear damage from 13-3 to 11-3 but now has +First-Strike and +Aimed (50% version marskman)

ELE - Fallen
I'm lowering upcoming values of consume ratio, because it's what make fallen be OP.
No, it's not balanced how units end having more health than maximun health too often at adquiring unlimited amounts of health.
Various max Lv3 absurdly low XP to reheal... tamer and level up scream being mele instead of ranged lol best errors.

Will focus in few standard values.

Lich Adept
It's cost efficiency is just absurd, has tons of bulkyness and somewhat decent damage at both mele and ranged, even at being
a much better choice than Skeletal Witch in terms of cost efficiency. It does even have 6 movement and 35 HP...
 - Chillwave is now +Enchanted (always 60% hit chance)
 - XP from 34 to 42
Giving it a fair margin to still be "stronger" than it's intended to be, but it was really necessary to slightly nerf it.

There is a lot of complaints about this unit, specially because of the fact of having backstab in a somewhat weak ranged, special that
