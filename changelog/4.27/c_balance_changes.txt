AE - Dark Legion
Adjustments to Drones in this faction and few other units.

Crossbowman 
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - XP from 70 to 80
 - Price from 25g to 27g
 
Advanced Crossbowman
 - Movement from 6 to 5

Drone Protector
 - No longer has steadfast!
 - Pierce/Cold/Blade resistances from 10% to 20% (the same values as before counting steadfast).
 - Price from 36g to 32g
Huge Orocia/RPG nerf, but a somewhat decent buff in other game modes.
Also this makes +Armored trait protector drones no longer be OP with their steadfast.
 
 
Drone
 - Claws damage from 9-2 to 8-2
 
Their main purpose is being a somewhat cheap unit that can reach/move well in any kind of terrain. Blade damage for soldiers in dark legion.
Also they have an optional poison mele. I just don't want ppl spamming drones in any kind of mode, will test later.


Sentry Drone
 - Impact resistance from -5% to 0%
 - Blade resistance from -5% to -10%
 - Price from 28g to 30g
 
Defining better their weakness/resistances. Apart makes no sense lowering lv1 impact res from 0% to -5%.
 

Assault Drone
 - Health from 40 to 42
 - Claws damage from 7-3 to 6-3
 - Energy Shock damage from 9-3 to 7-4 (to be more different from Protector's drone ranged)
 - Price from 29g to 30g

Seems fair lowering slighyly this unit so it has "almost" lv1 mele unit retaliation and 7-4 fire ranged.
Being 50% flat defense and lower weaknesses than Sentry Drones makes this a somewhat decent flat holder defender.
Not very tanky, but will always deal decent damage in retaliation in any of the 2 ranges (mele and ranged alike)

War Drone
 - Claws damage from 9-3 to 8-3
 - Energy Shock damage from 10-4 to 11-4
(it demands a tons of XP to lv3, apart that 11-4 marskman is inferior thatn red mage's 12-4 magical).


Dark Raider
 - Health from 38 to 36
 - Torch damage adjusted from 4-3 to 6-2
 - Fire resistance from 0% to 10%
This way, its torch will have more pressence as a 6-2 (that can be 9-2 at night if strong trait)
Less tanky, but can have a more notisable pressence in the battlefield with that adjusted torch attack.

Dark Pillager
 - Sword damage from 6-4 to 7-4
 - Fire resistance from 10% to 20%
No lv3 mounted unit that has -1 blade damage than the other option, but an 8-3 mele torch attack, compensed as well for its 20% fire res.

Gunner's XP from 60 to 70 (more popular than Halberd)

AE - Desert Elves 
First notisable stuff is that this faction only has 5 recruitable units... second is that they do not have any fire/impact ranged mage...
Interventions to this faction's unit repricement, and new units will be done this time by myself.

[NEW UNIT] 
Dust Faerie 
HP: 29
Movement: 6
3-3 claws pierce mele
8-2 Dust Tornado +Magical

XP: 45 (32 XP at 70% XP modifier)

Resistances
 -10% to arcane and impact
 +10% to fire
 +20% to pierce
Price: 19g
 
My opinion: 

"An unit that has 50% at most of common terrains (flat, forest, hills, etc), while having 1 movement cost at there.
Are good counters of Swift-Foots, Skeletons and more useful againist troll-whelps and HI's than archers. 
Sligthly resistant to pierce/fire which makes them somewhat more tanky againist loyalists. 
20% to pierce allows them to be used more aggresively againist enemy archers.
Mele being pierce is a choice of mine to add more pierce to the faction , fighters being 6-4 mele and arhcers being only 4-4 at ranged.
This unit is not meant to be very cost efficient, it's completing a role that the faction was missing.
Hope to not have misstaken at giving them 6 movement instead of 5, but their HP seems somewhat low to me, but they're not meant
to be tanker than archers at all, but want to make them feel somewhat different compared to other units in AE desert elves"


[NEW UNIT] 
Dusk Twist

Movement: 6
5-3 claws pierce mele
9-3 Dust Tornado +Magical

Resistances

Coment about the unit:
Well, it's not as strong as the other advancement, but if well used can tank well a lot of damage, still, againist certain factions
it's not a recomendable unit to consider. But this unit is slightly underpowered because of certain OP RPG potentail, apart that
it's the only source of arcane attack type in the whole faction. Will see if later this unit will need buff or not, but consider this
advancement is completely optional. Only in case of if needed, I could lower impact weakness later.

Desert Archer 
There's no need to be loyal to campaign's desert elves values, this is just an AE's adaptation and will modify values for fairness.
 - Health from 29 to 31
 - Price from 17g to 15g

Desert Ranger's price from 40g to 38g
Desert Avenger's price from 80g to 57g

Desert Marskman 
 - HP from 37 to 40
Not being capable of being 70% def at forest, makes this unit some what more fragible than elvish marskman, reason why they deserve
to have some extra HP at all levels.

Desert Sharpshooter
 - HP from 47 to 50
 - Price from 90g to 53g
 
Desert Fighter
 - Price from 15g to 16g
 - XP from 40 to 44
It's weird viewing a unit that is 6-4 mele and aditionaly having any ranged in whole Ageless... a somewhat strong unit.

Desert Captain's price from 34g to 35g
Desert Marshal's price from 80g to 57g

Desert Hero
 - XP from 80 to 88
 - Price from 28g to 32g
 
Desert Champion's price from 100g to 55g
Talking sincerely, one of most beast mele damages among all lv3 if only this unit has strong trait at day for a total of 14-5 blade attack.

Desert's Prowler price from 90g to 57g

Desert Rider price from 28g to 31g
Desert Outrider price from 43g to 46g

Desert Horseman's Sword damage from 7-5 to 6-5

Elvish Shyde price from 94g to 52g



_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

AE - Deep Elves
Some variations to AE's deep elves, mostly to adapt more fairness and certain resistances variation between the faction.
These proposals are a desviation of original deep elves, which their gameplay will be still be different as of the other deep elves faction
in add-ons servers. In each desition made by me I will explain my reasons of why by my personal criteria.

Will make most of deep elves be 40% frozen defense and 1 movement cost there, to increase the amount of total maps in which they can be
viable to use, apart that will help them like how movement costs are in the side of drakes in default era.

Bloodmaiden
First point of this, is that I will worse much her resistances but maintaining her 7-4 blade mele, making her the indeeed highest damage
dealer between all 4 strikes fighter in whole Ageless era, but at certain cost of taking more damage than a regular fighter.
An unit that the faction WILL need for real damage, but that will not be spammable because of obvious reasons.
 - HP from 29 to 30
 - Movement from 7 to 6
 - Arcane resistance from 10% to -10%
 - Impact resistance from 10% to 0%
 - Pierce resistance from 0% to -10%
 - Swallow water defense from 20% to 30%
 - Swallow water movement cost from 3 to 2
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1
 - XP from 35 to 42
 - Price from 15g to 16g
 
Basically, this unit is an explosive +40% damage version of common 5-4 fighters, but takes some extra damage againist blade/pierce attacks
and not resistant to arcane any longer. An unit that has to be recruited in moderation but that can deal heavy damage.

This unit cannot be considered as fighter, instead, could be considered as "assasin" or somekind of that. This unit will deal heavy damage
at the cost of its own survavility, which will make of her a less cost efficient mele unit than spearmen or something else in other factions.

Aditionally, blooodmaiden and advamcenemts will be 30% swallow defense instead of 20% and movement cost 2 instead of 3.
(considered this as a quite decent compensation for all the nerfs done to this line) that will help her chase/escape at specific situations.


Vengance
 - Health from 38 to 42
 - Movement from 7 to 6
 - Sword damage increased from 9-4 to 8-5
 - Arcane resistance from 10% to -10%
 - Impact resistance from 10% to 0%
 - Pierce resistance from 0% to -10%
 - Swallow water defense from 20% to 30%
 - Swallow water movement cost from 3 to 2
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1
 - Price from 27g to 30g
 - Now will advance to Seeker

8-5 in terms of lv2 damage is lower than 7-4 in standards of lv1 damage. But Vengance can gain strong trait for a total of 9-5 blade mele
thing that default's death-blade can't. Defense/Movement costs are the same for lv3.


[NEW UNIT]
Seeker
HP: 52
Movement: 7
 Sword 9-6 blade mele 
 

 Resistances
 -10% to arcane, pierce and blade

Price: 48g

This unit's damage with Aspect of the hunter if strong and if using the skill can be a absolutely devastating 12-6 mele unit.
Thing is that, this unit takes so much extra damage and her base health is betwen lv2 standards (with een weaknesses, less tankier
than lv2 fighter afterall). Reasons why this unit is -10% at 3 common attack types (blade/pierce/arcane).
Also in Orocia/RPG gameplay , her high damage-output shines cause of her base 6 strikes.


Night Maiden 
On this case, I will adapt the Nightstaker's Crossbow to AE Maiden line since lv1, but splitting damges as a 2 strikes ranged.
Being a crossbow that can be reloaded before firing, could explain it's first strike. Adapting mele to be +Marskman to make the unit
more notisable between various BloodMiadens at having at least more CTH, specially againist swift foot.
 - Health from 27 to 32
 - Movement from 7 to 6
 - Sword attack adjusted from 8-3 to 6-3 and now +Marskman
 - NEW ATTACK: Crossbow 5-2 pierce ranged +first-strike
 - Arcane from 10% to -10%
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Blade resistance from -10% to +10%
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1
 - Price from 16g to 18g
 
Nightstalker
 - Health from 35 to 38
 - Movement from 8 to 6
 - Sword damage adjusted from 11-3 to 8-3 and now +Masrkman
 - NEW ATTACK: Crossbow 8-2 pierce ranged +first-strike
 - Arcane from 10% to -10%
 - Cold/pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Blade resistance from -10% to +20%
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1
Somewhat low health, but has skirmisher, 6 movement and fairly good resistances.

Baroness
 - Health from 43 to 46
 - Movement from 9 to 7
 - Sword damage from 13-3 to 11-3 and now +marskman
 - NEW ATTACK: Crossbow 11-2 pierce ranged +first-strike
 - Arcane from 10% to -10%
 - Cold/pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Blade resistance from -10% to +20%
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1
Talking honestly, this skimirsher deals a tons of damage, up to 14-3 +marskman at night, just that its 46 base HP is terrible for a lv3
Health, still, somewhat awarded with decent resistances being only weak to arcane attacks.


Vault Lurker
 - Health from 32 to 36
 - Movement from 8 to 7
 - Sword damage from 9-4 to 7-4 +Marskman
 - NEW ATTACK: Crossbow 6-2 pierce ranged +First-Strike
 - Arcane from 10% to 0%
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Blade resistance from -10% to +10%
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1
 

Priestess of the Vault
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1

Matriarch's Price from 26g to 30g


Patroness
 - price from 45g to 50g
 - Now will advance to Harbinger
 
 
[NEW UNIT]
Harbinger
HP: 66
Movement: 6
 Faerie Touch 11-2 arcane mele
 Shadow wave 12-5 impact ranged +Skilled
 

 Resistances
 +20% to impact/arcane
 +10% to fire/cold
  +0% to pierce/blade

Price: 80g

This addition is rightful to be done because of 2 strong reasons, the first one, making Patroness a viable option for RPG games as well
at convincing players about another viable alternative option appart of spamming strikes at Seer's implosion attack.
Second, giving Orocia's Last wave another dangerous lv4 unit, on this case an Heavy physical damage caster.
Not as dangerous as EoMa's Guru but has higher concentrated damage to single target and 6 movement (instead of 5) of floating as well.

Seer
Only 2 changes, first to slightly nerf it on RPG and second changing her mele to be slightly different from Patroness
 - Faerie Touch adjusted from 9-2 to 6-3
 - Implosion damage from 45-1 to 42-1
 - Price from 42g to 48g

Looks irrelevant, but -3 damage per strike (even if it's under 10% of base damage) can make certain difference in competitive RPG's as
creep wars. 5 Sucessful strikes means 15 less damage that enemy player will receive cause of this nerf, which in very specific situations
could be the difference if a player could be slain or not. I refuse downgrading lower than this one value.

Tyrhai Rider

Exception with movement costs in frozen is here, but instead it gets 1 MP cost at sand and 40% def at both sand and frozen.
But 2 MP cost at frozen, afterall, buffs ARE BUFFS, JUST AGREE WITH'EM !!!
Apart slight differences with movement costs increases versality on faction.
Natural reasons: in default era, Tyrhai Rider are the natural counters of drakes and they need to not have issues at chasing drakes.
Apart, in 1vs1 this unit losses to drake clasher.

Minotaur
Increasing slightly damage, resistances but decreasing cost (which will make them less cost efficient) and reworking horns.
Also, +10% def at mountains. But no frozen/sand buffs and Movement cost at fungus to 1, so they have full smoth movement in all cave tiles.
Extra 3 --> 2 swallow water movement cost considering their muscled body.

 - Fist damage from 8-2 to 11-2

Lidh
After thinking really well what to exactly do to this unit, I got a nice idea for this. Now its role will be more offensive.
 - Faerie Fire no longer has +Stardust but instead has +Aimed (50% version of Marskman)
 - Arcane resistance from 10% to 30%
 - Fire/Cold resistances from 0% to 20%
 - Impact from 10% to 0%
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1

 - Faerie fire damage from 4-4 to 5-3 (worsening in RPG)
 - Arcane resistance from 10% to 30%
 - Blade resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Fire/Cold resistances from 0% to 10%
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Frozen movement cost from 2 to 1
 - Price from 29g to 30g
 - usage=archer to usage=fighter (for whenever AI can recruit this unit, will now do it at its corresponding role)

Was thinking a while, is this right if Night-Stalker has now 8-3 blade +marskman as mele? then got it and got convinced it is.
Differences between aligment and amount of strikes (and arcane ranged) allows this unit to still have a role even if having level up
Night-Stalkers. Can suit in the same army if owning both units, so it's fine yeah.

It has a tons of animations to look smoothly, thing which I'm not going to spend my efforts because of already reworking too hard
in AE_deep_elves faction in overall. The lots of resistances adjustments, certain attacks adjustments, new attacks for few existing units,
and even new advamcement and new recruitable orb for AE_deep_elves with very slight modification to
