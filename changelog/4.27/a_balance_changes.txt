AE - Steelhive
My first attempt of creating a new unit by myself! the Level up of Lightshifter : Steel Mirage

Lightshifter 
 - XP from 90 to 40
 - Now can advance to: Steel Mirage
 
NEW UNIT! 
Steel Mirage Lv1
 HP : 32
 MP : 5
 Colide 4-1 impact mele
 Light ray 6-2 arcane ranged +concentrated (+1 damage per strike per sucesful hit) +Aimed (50% version of marksman)

Resistances:
 - 85% to arcane 
 - 65% to fire/Cold
 - 0% to blade/pierce
 - -20% to impact
 
AMLA XP: 86 (60 at 70% modifier)
Cost: 15g (in era of heroes)

This unit is not strong, but is fairly viable considering it takes only 1/3 damage from cold/fire attacks and 1/7 of arcane attacks.
Which is a valuable shield againist heavy mages, taking only 6-4 from Default's arch mage. 

And its damage scales better than of average archers, at having both +aimed and +concentrated extras.
Fair enough to no have lv2.

In villages (60% defense) this unit is hard to destroy considering it's high 60% defense and absurd magical resistance which 
are aditionally excelent village keepers.

Apostate
 - Cave movement cost from 3 to 2 (it can decide if walking or "fly")
 - Price from 57g to 55g
 
Daemon
 - Fireball damage from 7-3 to 6-3 (but compensed by the following defense buffs)
 - Forest defense from 40% to 50%
 - Hills defense from 40% to 50%
 - Village defense from 50% to 60%
 - Cave movement cost from 3 to 2
Nerfing ranged damage but compensed by extra utility, which in overall is better apreciated.
 
Archdaemon
 - Scyche has now +First-Strike
 - Fireball damage from 10-3 to 5-5
 - Forest defense from 40% to 50%
 - Hills defense from 40% to 50%

Adjusted its attacks to make it a somewhat more interesting unit. 
Intention was to lower the base damage of fireballs, but making it a more interesting attack which in overall, scales worse at
+25% daytime (6-5 vs 12-3 is really different), but compensed by a somewhat crappy 8-4 but now +first-strike

Unit will now take less damage considering the lots of +10% defense, so the nerf of ranged damage is worth its price.

Finally the rightful and needed nerf of phantom defenses which was caused by a wrong implementation of only Feather dancer buffs.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Imperial - Lavinian Legion
Some adjustment to this faction, certain units have too much damage in this faction. While the whole faction having problems to cold attacks.
Some units will get a slight bonus to cold resistance.

Auxiliary arcane resistance from 0% to 10%

Light Infantryman / Rorarius
 - Fire weakness from -10% to 0%
 - Impact resistance from -20% to -15%
Don't want to lower any other physical weakness in order to perserve the unit's original essence.
 
Skirmisher / Velite
 - Cold resistance from 10% to 20%
 - Impact resistance from -20% to -15%
 - spear damages from 10-3 and 10-2 to 9-3 and 8-2
Slightly weak to fire, but more resistant to cold than other 2 lines.
 
Slinger / Funditor
 - Fire resistance from -10% to 0%
Lowest of all resistances (-20% to impact), cause of decent mele/ranged. 

Praetorian Guard
 - Correctly applying this time Pilum damage from 7-2 to 5-2 
Preventing this unit be 9-2 ranged at daytime, maintaining the best of the attack the +slows

Feudal Orcish Knagates
After certain rework to knagates, they're stronger than they used to be, still somewhat underpowered. I'm buffing here.

 
Gobling Flanker
Flanker's damage adjustments, in order to make it somewhat more useful in mele in terms of army size, but nerfing slightly their ranged.
 - Knife damage adjusted from 8-2 to 6-3
 - Harpoon damage from 7-3 to 6-3

At this point, it's mele is not just as Warrior's -1 mele damage and somewhat more useful attack, and certainily more realistic.
Icewind herders are now 7-3 pierce +magical cause of buff, there is no problem at nerfking flanker's ranged damage slightly as its 
main purpose is slowing enemies.
 
Gobling Striker
 - Swallow water defense from 20% to 30%
 - Swamp defense is intended to be 40% but is being 30%.
 - Mountains defense from 50% to 60%
 - Price from 22g to 27g
 
Spearhead 
 - XP from 43 to 45
 - Price from 16g to 18g as wanted

Warrior
Concerning to recent buffs of +6% blade resistance and 4-1 hatchet
 - XP from 34 to 42
 
Bladesman
 - XP from 70 to 80
 - Price from 28g to 30g
Stronger unit deserves highger prices and higher XP to lv3, but is a much better lv2 than it used to be 2 versions ago.

Spearman XP from 70 to 75
