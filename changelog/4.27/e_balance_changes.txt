EoF - Brungars
An apreciable revision to brungars, fixing few not so fine details at here.

Undecited Student
A lv0 that is unnecesairly too good... a lv0 that is 7-2 which is already lv1 damage and exagerated +Marskman on ranged.
 - Fist damage from 7-2 to 6-2

 - XP from 20 to 25
 
Ocean Apprentice 
 - Fist damage from 7-2 to 6-2
 - Price from 18g to 19g (just in case if Era of Heroes)
 
Ice Apprentice
It's indebatible that this option is much worse as unit than Wave rider patch. Will do some slight changes.
 - Ice hammer from 5-3 to 6-3
 - Cold resistance from 40% to 20%
 - Fire resistance from -20% to 0%
 
Crystal Master

 - Price from 70g to 54g
 
 --> Crab's health from 30 to 32 (as monster cannot gain traits at all)
on a later revision maybe for upcoming 4.28 I would like to change the race of various animals that are actually considered "monsters"
to "animal" race.

EoF - Nordhiris
Saw very recently very specific situation of underpowered at here, I'm buffing only these few cases.

Northern Archer 
Actually a very cost ineficient archer, I'm buffing it.
 - Health from 29 to 30
 - Movement from 5 to 6
 - XP from 44 to 42

Northern Strongbow
 - Movement from 5 to 6
 
Northern Greatbow
 - Movement from 5 to 6
 - Price from 44g to 46g
 
Northman 
 - Village/Mountain defense from 50% to 60%
The only Nordhiris unit that will have 60% village/Mountain defense, otherwise this unit is somewhat too cost ineficient. 
 
Northguard
... a lv2 with only 6-4 blade mele and 5-3 pierce ranged , basically it has (almost) lv1 damages unlike the other advancement.
 - Bow damage from 5-3 to 6-3
 - Village/Mountain defense from 50% to 60%
 
Slaughterer
This is at most a buff test. Slaughterer has stats of a lv2 that can advance to lv3 ... will give a conditional buff.
 - Now has +Forest-Keeping (this unit will heal+4 per turn if on forest tile)
 - Mountains movement cost from 3 to 2
Not that much, nordhiris has easy access to heal+4 units, but this gives a little more of flexibility to slaughterer, specially if he
far of his alies; which additionally follows his description.
 
Poacher & Prowlers
Guessed they were too weak, but realized they level up really fast, not doing changes. They can become 7-6 (8-6 if lv3) with no real
difficulty, which is only means an early game heavy damage dealer. Also their lower tier poison least can troll regen or healing in villages.

Wildheart / Feralheart / Wolfheart
 - Forest defense from 50% to 60%
 - Feralheart's price from 38g to 41g
 - Wolfheart's price from 55g to 63g
This option is on survivals considerably weaker than the other patch, also leadership and better resistances are more notisable. So I'm buffing.

Nothernfighter 
 - Price from 20g to 26g (leadership and low-upkeep advantages)
No longer insanely cost efficient.

Nothern Warrior
 - Price from 30g to 45g
Lv3 leadership aura for only 30g is INSANE. Basically it's buying a lv2 with lv3 aura that can boost alied units damage considerably.
Still much cheaper than other lv3 leadership units in the game, and -1 upkeep per turn, it's fine really.

Nordhiris Warlord
 - Price from 40g to 66g
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

MERCS - Infernai
Actual hidden overpowered, facts that not so many part of the community knows due the impopularity to of the faction.
Originally planned to only nerf lost soul movetype (slightly) and decreasing unwalkable defense... but more needs to be done...

Infernai's movetype
 - Unwalkable defense from 50% to 40%

Controlled's XP from 24 to 30
Possesed's XP from 50 to 60

Hellhound's price from 34g to 32g

Fiend XP from 34 to 37
Scamp's (unrecruitable, except in heroes) price from 14g to 16g

Demon's Price from 25g to 29g
 --- Leadership increasing cost of this unit. Still cheap leadership aura and somewhat high HP. So it's fine.

 
Devil
 - Sword (fire) damage from 14-3 to 13-3
 - Fireball damage adjusted from 14-1 to 7-2
 - XP from 100 to 115
 - Price from 43g to 53g
 
Lucifer
 - Sword (fire) damage from 18-3 to 17-3
 - Fireball damage from 10-3 to 9-3
 - Price from 53g to 72g
 
Horned One
It's charge attack and general sword damage are real problems. Horn at night can one hit various Lv3 units if sucessful hit, while sword's damage
is just so exagerated. I don't think that 72-1 at night is balanced :)
 - Sword damage from 14-4 to 13-4
 - Horn damage from 30-1 to 24-1
 - Fireball damage from 14-1 to 11-1
 - Price from 43g to 53g
Appart of the brutal potential this unit has in RPG/Creep wars with its horn... reason why I lowered a whole -6 dmg to horn.

Archfiend's price from 26g to 30g
Bloodbather's price from 43g to 48g

Hell Dweller
 - XP from 32 to 39
 - Fungus defense from 70% to 60%
 - Unwalkable defense from 60% to 40%
 - Price from 13g to 15g
 
Infernal Troglodyte
 - XP from 54 to 65
 - Fungus defense from 70% to 60%
 - Unwalkable defense from 60% to 40%
 - price from 25g to 28g
 
Infernal Troglodyte
 - Fungus defense from 70% to 60%
 - Unwalkable defense from 60% to 40%
 - Price from 43g to 50g
 
Pit Master 
 - Price from 43g to 47g
 
Tormentor 
 - Whip (blade) damage from 10-3 to 9-3
 - Flamming Whip damage from 20-1 to 18-1

Lost Soul / Evil Essence
 - Swallow/Deep water movement cost from 3 to 2

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAIC - Ukians
Will do some important adjustments to Ukians, specially to specific units.

Ukian Race (Spearmen, archers and advancements) 
 - Sand movement cost from 2 to 1 (still, they maintain their 40% sand defense).
 - Fungus movement cost from 3 to 2
 - Impasable defense from 90% to 10%

Seress
Seems that many players are not comfortable with this unit enough, apart of low heal+4 seems that her stats are not enough good
for common skill levels, so I'm going to do some buffs favoring a better experience with the only lv2 healer of Ukians.
 - She will now heal+6 !!
 - Health from 37 to 39
 - Fire/Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
 - XP from 68 to 77 (stronger lv2 and OP lv3 deserves more XP, but at least her step on lv2 is more acceptable now)
 - Price from 24g to 28g
 
Ukian Witch
 - Fire/Cold resistances from 40% to 30%
 - Frozen defense from 60% to 40%
 - Price from 38 to 51

Ukian Veteran 
 - Health from 50 to 52
 - Throwing axe from 8-3 to 7-3
 - Price from 25g to 28g
 
Ukian Signalman
 - Health from 50 to 52
 - Axe from 12-3 to 11-3
 - Torch damage from 16-2 to 15-2
 
Ukian Flaresman
 - Price from 34g to 51g (illuminates aura and more lv3 price like)
 
 Ukian Officer
 - Impact resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Price from 30g to 32g
 
Ukian Subcommander
 - Health from 76 to 70 (they're super tank for being lv3 leadership aura?)
 - Price from 45g to 57g
 
Ukian Commander 
 - Price from 65g to 77g
 
Ice Seal
 - Health from 26 to 30
 - Frozen defense from 70% to 65%
 
Seal Iceblade
 - Health from 37 to 39
 - Impact resistance from 80% to 20% (major bug fixing lol)
 - Frozen defense from 70% to 65%
 
 
Nothern Ranger
This unit is actually an exceptionally OP tank !! basically used to be swift-foot with even PHYSICAL resistances !!
And making it a more offensively notisable unit.
 - Sword damage from 7-3 to 8-3 and now is +Aimed (50% marskman)
 - Cold resistance from 50% to 35%
 - Flat defense from 60% to 50%
 - Castle / Village / Forest / Hill defense from 70% to 60%
 - Fungus defense from 70% to 50%
 - Sand movement cost from 1 to 2
 - Frozen defense from 40% to 50% (as much as of flat)
Let's make him swim!
 - Deep water movement cost from 99 to 4 and defense to 30%
 - Price from 25g to 32g
 
 
 
Only left his 70% defense at mountains. Facts are that this unit can easily deal so much damage by receiving too low damage.
Thing that more skilled players can demostrate as broken. Actually being flawless this unit is extraordinarly good... a way too much.รง

Imagine a lv2 dwarf with 60% flat defense, 70% def at forest and lv1 damages, yup this is Nothern Ranger!
At least with his new +Aimed he can be a somewhat good counter of Swiftfoots or units that depend on their 70% defense terrain.
He still maintains all his positive physical resistances, considered more a problem his actual too high defense values.

Imperial - Marauders
Actually these very movible but volatile (high damage , low toughness) have certain issues, at ending into a very devastating victory 
or the very opposite a devastating defeat. Will do some interventions to marauders.

Axeman 
 - Health from 32 to 34
 - Axe damage from 6-3 to 5-3 (preventing them to be 9-3 at night if strong)
Focusing him to be mostly a ranged damage support. Apart there are already too many 7-3 blade in the faction, so I think this will not
hurt that much marauders gameplay.

Hunter 
 - Axe damage from 7-3 to 5-4
 - Price from 42g to 30g
There are already too many 3 strikes blade mele of 9 or 10 damage, adjusting this. Also, it will make lv1 units attack him at night
at mele be more temptative as taking less damage in the very first strikes, specially at night (9-3 to 6-4 at night if not strong or
10-3 vs 7-4 if strong).

Woodsman
 - Axe damage from 11-4 to 10-4
 - Price from 70g to 47g
This nerf gives an important early game difference, 12-4 vs 14-4 at night, precising of strong trait for a 14-4 instead of 15-4.

Crusher
Unlike many berserkers, rage(3) is an event that only triggers on attack not while defending, and in very specific situations this unit
can be considered as game breaker (these units that for too low effort can define too early the result of a game as product of Overpowerement)
Doesn't suffer at all of any handicap of having rage(3) special on mele.
 - Health from 36 to 37
 - Blade resistance from 10% to 0% (they actually don't need it)
 - Hills defense from 60% to 50%
 
Mauler
 - Hills defense from 60% to 50%
There are various fighters that can cover better hills terrain, not letting Mauler do a defensive role as good as other fighters.

Fay's price from 19g to 20g

Seereess
 - Cold Blast damage from 10-3 to 9-3
 - Price from 30g to 32g
 
Galdra
 - Fist damage from 8-4 to 7-4
 - price from 30g to 52g
 
Shieldmaiden
 - Spear damage from 12-2 to 11-2
 
Valkyrie
 - Health from 64 to 60
 - Spear damage from 15-2 to 14-2
 - Arcane resistance from -20% to 30%
 - Price from 40g to 53g
 
Raider 
 - Net damage from 7-2 to 6-2
 
Jarl
 - Sword damage from 12-3 to 11-3
 - Price from 30g to 36g
 
Lord's price from 75g to 57g

Pillager 
 - Sword damage from 10-4 to 9-4 (look a lv2 that if strong can be a devastating 14-4 at nights ...)
 - Price from 30g to 32g
Its lv2's damage was even more exagerated than lv3's damage between lv3's standards.

Scorcher
 - Price from 90g to 53g

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Imperial - Orcs gladiators
Will do certain adjustments to orcei gladiators as they have some serious balance issues with the damage some of their units are capable
to do. 

Latronis XP from 22 to 30

Venator
 - Health from 32 to 33
 - Bow damage from 8-3 to 7-3 but maintains +marksman
 - Bow (fire) damage from 10-2 to 8-2 and is now +Aimed (50% version of marksman)
 - Price from 19g to 18g
 
Venator Faber
 - Health from 40 to 42
 - Bow damage from 12-3 to 11-3 but maintains +marksman
 - Bow (fire) damage from 16-2 to 13-2 and now is +Aimed
 - Fire resistance from 0% to 10% (will make them to be less affraid when attacking fire based mages or shielding againist them)
 - Price from 38g to 36g 
Hard to define what's best to do on here, but Orcei Gladiators don't have any mage.
A thing is sure that Venator Faber is strongest non elf archer in whole ageless, but cannot lv3 and is somewhat fragible.
Also, abou Fire arrow, it's more effective againist objectives with at least 60% or higher defense than its original attack and it also
makes the attack scale better with upcoming upgrades of damage, as it doesn't has any lv3.
I'm sure that these limitations on mages and healers could hit somewhat hard to various players that tries them.
 
Essedarius
 - Fangs damage from 7-2 to 6-2
 - Swallow water movement cost from 6 to 5
 - [ATTEMPT] Swamp movement cost from 6 to 5
 - Frozen defense from 20% to 30% 

Essedarius Vulpis
 - Fangs damage from 8-3 to 7-3
 - Swallow water movement cost from 6 to 5
 - [ATTEMPT] Swamp movement cost from 6 to 5
 - Frozen defense from 20% to 30% 
 
Gallus 
 - Price from 16g to 15g
Seems a bit overpriced, will low their cost by 1 less, dwarvish fighter is a more clever unit. 

Murimillo
 - Sword damage from 10-3 to 9-3 (devastating infantry charge attack that needs to be lowered!)
 - XP from 60 to 72
 - Price from 26 to 28
 
Murmillo Leonis 
 - Fire resistance from -10% to 0%
Weaker lv2 that needs more XP to lv3 needs a slight compesation on lv3.

Dimacherius price from 26g to 28g
Dimacherius Fortis price from 55g to 48g

Provocator 
 - sword damage from 11-3 to 10-3
 - XP from 70 to 72
 
Provocator Leonis 
 - fire resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Price from 55g to 52g (charge > Marksman, reason of diferent pricing)
 
Piscator 
 - XP from 18 to 25
 
Retiarius
 - Trident damage adjusted from 7-3 to 10-2
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - Price from 16g to 17g

Fleet Retiarius
 - Trident damage from 13-3 to 15-2
 - Price from 47g to 32g
 
Paegniarius
 - Price from 35g to 30g
 
Brutal Paegniarius
 - Price from 65g to 53g
Tons of health... will need to test this to see if it can be considered as fair lol, but it has almost no resistances.
As well it doesn't has regen, also consider it's from a faction that has no healers.

Bestiarius
 - Price from 35g to 32g
 
Feral Bestiarius 
 - Price from 65 to 53g
 
Khampsa
 - Price from 27g to 29g
 
Khampsa Audentis
 - Price from 55g to 53g
 
Hoplomachus
Actually a terrible unit, basically can't tank well because its poor health, it's slow, doesn't has good damage, let's buff.
 - Health from 40 to 46
 - Spear damage from 7-3 to 8-3
 
Hoplomachus Fortis
 - Health from 55 to 58
 -`Price from 60g to 55g
 
Secutor 
 - Price from 26g to 28g
 
Secutor Leonis
 - Health from 50 to 53
 - Sword damage adjusted from 4-8 to 5-7
 - Price from 46g to 51g

 
Thraex
 - Price from 26g to 28g
50% flat defense is something considerably useful, helps at tanking in plains... okey.

Thraex Paratus 
 - Price from 55g to 53g
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

MERCS - Fanatics
Fixing a pair of things that need to be nerfed.

Mindless
An unit being berserk in a faction that has easy acess to slowing special... and being capable to ignore most physical resistances
by berserking with fire mele... ofc has to be nerfed. IT CAN DEFEAT AN SLOWED ROYAL GUARDSMAN (Lv3 unit) in similar defense and neutral ToD.
 - Health from 58 to 52
 - Torch damage from 12-2 to 11-2
 - Hills defense from 60% to 50%
 
Genie / Master genie
 - Unwalkable defense from 60% to 50%
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Archaic - Phamtom
Will copy/Paste all proposed at AE part a) AND implementing more stuff to that for part e)
I can say I was wrong that Phamtom needed just nerfs, but problem is that they SUCK againist default undeads!
So even knowing this, apart of the already mentioned nerfs I will add new stuff to Phantom.

Will separate the already mentioned in part A) and still implement it AND adding to that new stuff from part E)

 ------  [PART A list of changes]
Archaic - Phantom
Finally the rightful and needed nerf of phantom defenses which was caused by a wrong implementation of only Feather dancer buffs.

Tomg Guardian and advancements
Fairly good movement costs and physical resistances, deserves defenses nerfs.
 - Forest/Hill/Fungus/Mountains defense from 60% to 50% 

Huntress and advancements
 - Forest/Hill/Fungus/Mountains defense from 60% to 50% 

Divine Jay
Its damage is a way too good... rusheable even as fighter, lowering damages.
 - Peak damage from 12-2 to 10-2
 - Talon damage from 8-3 to 7-3
 -----  [/PART A list of changes]


REVERTED THE 60% --> 50% MOUNTAINS DEFENSE IN SPECEFIED UNITS
SO, THEY WILL RETAIN THEIR 60% MOUNTAINS DEFENSE, EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE CHANGED IN DEFENSES.

Apart that fixing their bugged 60% defenses into their natural and wanted value of 50% could make phantom be more equilibrated
still, there are other important stuff (fixing lacks in faction) 

Aditionally, by fixing the misstaken 60% def of Phantom at these terrains, I'm lowering weaknesses to them.
 --> Tomb Guards (non steadfast) will no longer be fire weakness, new fist attacks to work better on skeletons and costs 1g less.
 --> Lv2 and Lv3 Huntress lowered Arcane weaknesses, new arcane arrows, standarized +10% cold res in all levels.
 --> Feather and advancements better slightly improved blade resistance and less weak to fire (defense nerf won't affect them)
 
As phantoms can't actually hide to fire/arcane, specific lines are now more resistant to fire and arcane.


Huntress
Thinking it really well, a cool extra that could receive these archers because THE FACTION NEEDS THAT is allowing huntress be
more useful againist undead like enemies is giving an optional unholy arrow special.
 - NEW ATTACK: Unholy missile 4-3 arcane ranged.
 - Bow no longer has +Strive
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 10% (this will help them living more often to 3 Dark Adept strikes)
 
Thinked that very physical/Pierce resistant units (ghost, skeletons, etc) mosat of them are weak to arcane.
At least a 80/70% hit chance source of ranged damage againist woses... as mummies cannot exploit wose's bad terrain defenses.
Still, againist high defense enemies lv0 mummies can do their work.


Archer 
 - Health from 40 to 42
 - NEW ATTACK: Unholy missile 6-3 arcane ranged +Aimed (50% marksman)
 - Arcane resistance from -10% to -5%
 - XP from 70 to 75
 
High Archer 
 - Arcane resistance from -10% to 0%
 
 
Tomb Guard 
Removing completely fire weakness on non steadfast Tomb Guards and advancements aswell of making glance plague work more often.
Giving new fist attack that is +66.67% effective againist default-like skeletons than theirs spears and can kind of scare with upgrades.
 - NEW ATTACK: Fist 5-2 impact mele
 - Glance damage adjusted from 5-1 to 3-2
 - Fire resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Price from 16g to 15g
 
Spear 9-2 (x0.4 = 3.6 --> 4-2 per strike) --- if on night , 3.6 x 1.25 = 4.5 (5-2?)
Fist 5-2 (x1.2 = 6 --> 6-2 per strile) ---- if on night , 6 x 1.25 = 7.5 (8-2?)
This is something to consider in WC II gameplay, so yea, I find it convenient.
Costless bonuses that could help slightly, no calculus have been done if strong trait, not that interested in looking these details myself.
 
 
Tomb Shield-Guard 
 - Glance damage from 8-1 to 4-2 
 
Tomb Sentinel
 - Health from 52 to 53
 - NEW ATTACK: Fist 6-3 impact mele
 - Glance damage adjusted from 8-1 to 4-2
 - Fire resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Pierce resistance from 25% to 30%
Consider the changes are being aplied while the nerf of -10% defense at various 60% def terrains.
They will at least now have an optional 3 strikes attack at last hitting very wounded enemies if needed. Which also works better on skeletons.
 
Tomb Protector 
 - Health from 65 to 68
 - NEW ATTACK: Fist 8-3 impact mele
 - Fire resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Pierce resistance from 25% to 30%

Feather Dancer
 - Blade resistance from 10% to 15%
 - Impact resistance from 15% to 20%
 - Fire/Arcane resistances from -20% to -15%
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 10% (same as default's fencers or huntress's buff)
Will now take 4-4 againist blade mele fighters that are commonly 5-4.
Free buffs to feather dancer as I realized average users can't benefit that well from them at all.

Only source of blade attack up to lv3 tomb guards... so made them be stronger in terms of durabilty.
I'm completely sure that anyone would prefer a more cost efficient but non-skirmisher unit as only source of blade attacks.
Adaptating Phantom to their actual limitations but at still working better.
 

Wing Dancer / Wing Warrior 
 - Blade resistance from 10% to 15%
 - Arcane resistance from -20% to -15%
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Wing Warrior's health from 64 to 60


Vapor Lv1
Basically, a new unit with a new role. It will now suicide into their enemies and deal damage at contact. Cheapest suiciding unit.
Will no longer be mirage like as Lightshifter doesn't since 4.26. Now a somewhat usable unit.
(No, if accomplishing its purpose, it will not give any XP to enemies)

Health: 1
Movement: 5
Movetype: AE_arc_phantom_spirit
Aligment: Chaotic
Cost: 6
(No ZoC)

exothermic dissipation 9-1 fire kamikaze +Ubiquitous (always 90% hit chance)
endothermic dissipation 6-1 cold kamikaze +Ubiquitous (always 90% hit chance)

Specials:
     {ABILITY_AE_SUICIDE}
     {ABILITY_SKIRMISHER}
 
Resistances: -899% to all (no, it will inevitably die in 1 hit always!)
Defenses: regularly 30% (as if your attacks are magical againist it)

Coment: 
It's intentionally less cost efficient than kamikaze gobling which is 20-1 always hit at 12g.
x2 of these can deal up to 16 fire damage in neutral time of day with 90% hit accuracy (another disadventage over kamikaze gobling).
Also, this unit has 6 movement, flying like movement and +Skirmisher, which is easier to make it contact with an enemy before being hit.
Remember that if enemy player finds to hit are free 4 XP to them.

Made it be Lv1 forcing that if used in afterlife gameplay it can at least give early XP buff to enemies if spammed by a player.

RE - Luz

Angel
 - Health from 27 to 31
 - Price from 18g to 17g
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

MERCS - Equestrians
Nerfing only Paladin's aligment as it it's a brutal counter of a large list of chaotic units which are weak to arcane.

Paladin 
 - Aligment changed to Neutral (will no longer be +25% damage by its own Illuminates aura)
 - Flail damage from 9-3 to 10-3
 
Affects at most arcane sword by decreasing it by a whole -25% damage on non night times.
While flail being only -1 less damage on non nightimes while only +1 dmg on night.
And ofc, this nerf hits harder if you give bonus damage to Paladin as there will not be a +25% booster by illuminates from being lawful.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

MERCS - Holy Order
Only HP nerfs for Inquisition and Torturer as their tankyness potential is just absurd by lowering by lowering by 15% the
damage of units on the same level than them and 15% times more the difference of levels.

Inquisition 
 - Health from 55 to 48
 - Price from 27g to 30g
 
Torturer 
 - Health from 74 to 62
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

EFM - Lizards
Actually they're pretty dangerous at their 90% def terrain againist archers. Reason why I'm lowering their 90% defenses to 85%.

Lizard (obtained by lv3 plague of Lizard Eye)
 - Impassable defense from 90% to 10%
 - Castle/Forest/Swamp/Swallow Water/Coastal Rift defenses from 90% to 85%
 - Deep Water defense from 80% to 40%
