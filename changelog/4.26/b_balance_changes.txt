AE - Steelhive
Some balance improvement to steelhive. Lightshifter nolonger will have that fuction that nobody wants to confuse enemy units at the cost of
loosing any obtained upgrades in orocia/RPG gameplay.

Steel Lightshifter 
This unit had planned to have lv1 advancement , but for now, will leave it a lv0 that can be somewhat useful that can be used as an excelent
magical damage sponge.
 - Removed like +200 lines of unwanted code were removed, in purpose to be a more normal unit.
 - Fire/Cold resistances from -10% to 60%
 - Blade/Pierce resistances are now 0%
 - Impact resistance from -20% to -30%
 - Description adjusted to unit's new functionality.

I don't even remember the changes proposed for lv0 / lv1 lightshifter that I proposed long ago, but this AMLA lv0 is quite acceptable, just
that it doesn't has ZOC never for now.

Steel Vector
 - Movement from 7 to 6
 - Stab damage from 9-4 to 8-4
 - Price from 37g to 34g
 
Steel Vorpal
 - Movement from 7 to 6
 - Stab damage from 13-4 to 11-4
 - Impact resistance from -20% to -10%
 - Price from 57g to 54g
 
Fidelant
 - Movement from 8 to 7
 - trample damage from 9-5 to 8-5
Yea, really good complete 16-5 damage, because 18-5 is really sick... but depending of so many strikes to deal complete damage means risks
from retaliations. For now , just lowering to 8-5. I Remember having adjusted this insane attack from 13-4 to 9-5 (a severe nerf considering charge)

Era of Myths
General overview to improve better EoM balance and amking it a better experience to be tried.
As far as I know, only Windsongs are currently in a good stima between AE community.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

EOM - The Warg 
Actually using this faction is pretty akward... there are some blatant underpowered here that must be buffed.
The fact is that nobody wants to use the warg faction due of being somewhat more akward to use than defaultlike factions.

Shapeshifter
 - Aurawave damage from 3-2 to 4-2
 
Changeling
 - Health from 44 to 47
 - XP from 85 to 75

Still a formidable unit, and a very complete fighter that is really worthy to have.

Pack leader price from 50g to 54g
Garou price from 68g to 72g
Moonblade price from 48g to 52g

EoM - Devlings
Uhm ... overgrowns modifications ehmmmm, I pretty dislike the results of lv1 overgrowns right now... basically, devlings are high in upkeep
if not recruiting nailers often, and usually ppl often prefer going the more worthy but stable overgrowns. I propose to make Lv1 overgrowns
somehwat highly cost efficient but hard to level up. As said in Warrior's description, overgrown ones aren't as bright than their smaller
companions.

And wtf have ocurried to nailers?! at their current status they're worthless as nothing else than free XP to enemies.
And they're actually not having ZOC and it's not even being mentioned!! (THIS can LITERALLY ruin your game, not being warned of no ZOC)

But basically, I'm seing that right now everything that aren't overgrowns nor Cursers are highly wrong in balance... and too underpowered
to even be considered to buy. Would have never imagined that devlings status could've been going that bad. 

I can't find possible that new results with nailers can be worse than their actual status. Compared to orcish grunts tehy're still weak.
And they're no ZOC , which hits hard in tactical means. 

Overgrown
 - Fist damage from 6-3 to 7-3
 - XP from 36 to 48
The fact is that spending XP in overgrowns that are weaker than loyalist lv2 fighters or elvish heros justificates the low pricing
of overgrowns. As well the somewhat akward traits that devlings carries with them.

Soldier
 - Health fro 45 to 47

Grand Hero price from 55g to 65g
Grand Chief price from 56g to 67g

Nailers
as compesation of overgrown's extra impact damage per strike, their impact has to be lowered.
And WHYYYYYY nailers have so low health?! basically they're free XP to enemies!!
Apart of being 40% flat defense... unlike other lv1 smaller devlings, highly underpowered!
No ZOC? let's make them cheap upkeepless health unit.
 - Health from 22 to 29 (+7 HP buff lv1...)
 - Nail Em damage from 15-1 to 14-1
 - Club'Em damage from 6-2 to 5-2
 - Arcane/Cold resistance from -10% to 0% (-1 impact damage's consideration vs undead faction)
 - XP from 32 to 40
 
Not attempting to give 50% flat defense, BUT, giving important toughtness buffs.
A thing is buying a cheap 11g upkeepless unit, other thing is buying a 11g unit that very likely is more useful for your opponent than 
for yourself... this unit deserves all these buffs to make it to at least be useful...

Spikers 
 - NEW ATTACK: Club em 10-2 impact mele
 - Arcane/Cold resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Blade/Fire resistance from 0% to 10%
Comes from cheap lv1 and has 1 upkeep less. Still some resistances buffs are harmless.

Staplers
 - NEW ATTACK: Club em 14-2 impact mele
 - Arcane/Cold resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Blade/Fire resistance from 0% to 10%

Flappers
Resistances buffs, actually their weaknesses makes this unit awful to use.
 - blade resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Arcane/Cold resistance from -20% to -10%

Flyers
 - Arcane/Cold resistance from -20% to -10%
 - Price from 27g to 30g
Not a quite popular unit and can't be 60% defense (except in funguss...), seems fair.

Attackers 
 - Arcane resistance from -20% to -10%
 - Price from 42g to 45g
 
Sneak
that hp... wat xd
 - Health from 13 to 16

EOM - Vampires
Some considerations to make this faction more friendly to use. Only a malbron slight nerf.

Blood Manipulator
Actually, there is not much sense picking this advancement instead of Flesh Artisan because the 2nd one being too superior. 
Giving Wipe attack to lv2 as well
 - NEW ATTACK : Wipe 10-2 arcane ranged +Enhanced
This will make this unit be more useful againist very fire resistant units like Fire elementals and others. 
Making this unit a better ranged support againist various type of units.

Flesh Artisan
 - Blood Boil damage from 8-3 to 7-3 (same as lv1)
Do not underrate units that have good damage at both ranged and mele, specially if any of these are +magical.

Being 9-3 mele and 7-3 +Magical oin ranged is still really fine, just that it's health is somewhat short for fighter role, BUT, its damages
are clearly fine AND still has more health than a generic mage (apart of if strong trait can 18-2 drain backstab mele at nights)

Sire price from 44g to 52g
Methusalem prie from 70g to 77g

Malborn
it's intention is not to kill nor to steal the kills, apart that being 4 mele strikes with poison can bother a lot.
 - Poisoned Knife damage from 4-4 to 3-4
 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

EOM - Elementals
Didn't see this one faction in really long in ageless. Let's do some performance updates.

Razorbird/Thunderbird
 - Fire resistance from 0% to 10%
 
Earth elemental
Basically this one is too tank for the low pricing it has. 50-60% defense available with 50% blade resistance and 60% to pierce.
Surely, this is not fine.
 - Mountains defense from 60% to 50%
 - XP from 37 to 45

Rock Golem
 - Mountains defense from 60% to 50%
 -- XP from 78 to 83
 
Stone Titan
 - Fist damage from 12-3 to 13-3
 - Mountains defense from 60% to 50%

Fire elemental XP from 34 to 42

Living Furnace
 - Fire claws damage from 9-3 to 14-2 (in order to diferenciate more from earth elementals) 
 - Price from 26g to 28g

Lava Beast 
 - Fire claws damage from 13-3 to 19-2
 - Price from 38g to 45g

Fire Wisp
 - Price from 34g to 32g
 
Vine Beast 
I disagree making this unit be 70% forest defense, but in compesation I want to make it more stable so it won't depend that much in 
forest terrain.
 - Pierce resistance from 20% to 30%
 - Forest defense from 70% to 60%
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Swamp defense from 30% to 40%
 - Swallow water defense from 20% to 30%
 - XP from 36 to 42
 - Price from 16g to 15g
At being more in synergy with nature, isn't unlogical it has +10% water tiles defense than average units.
 
Vine Tiger
 - Health from 46 to 51
 - Claws damage adjusted from 7-4 to 6-5
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Pierce resistance from 20% to 30%
 - Forest defense from 70% to 60%

 - Forest defense from 70% to 60%
 - Swamp defense from 30% to 40%
 - Swallow water from 20% to 30%
 
Ice Crab
Quite weak at its current status, let's make it somewhat worthy.
 - Pierce resistance from 10% to 20%
 - Fire resistance from -50% to -40%
 - Arcane resistance from -10% to 10%
 - Cold resistance from 90% to 80%
 - Price from 24g to 27g
 
Ice Shell

 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Cold resistance from 90% to 80%
 - Price from 35g to 45g

Hopefully these resistances makes this unit more viable choice.
