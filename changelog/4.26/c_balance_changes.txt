FEUDAL - Clockwork dwarves
These units have certain disbalances, adjusting.

Iron Golem Soldier
Minor nerfs, only to ranged at momment.
 - Flash cannon damage from 13-1 to 11-1
 - Price from 30g to 32g
 
Goliath
 - Flash Cannon damage from 19-1 to 16-1 and downgraded +Marskman to +Aimed (50% version marskman)
 - Price from 67g to 64g
 
Oiler 
 - Fireball damage from 10-2 to 9-2
 - Fire/Cold resistances from -10% to 0%

Blazer
 - Health from 59 to 60
 - Blaze damage from 18-2 to 17-2
 - Fire resistance from -10% to 20%
 - Cold resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Price from 61g to 54g
 
Armored Mechanic
Actually at this point, there is almost no reason to pick blazer right now, Armored mechanic used to have better resistances, heals+8 
and loss of damage wasn't that significant. Lowering seriously mechanic's general damage output but at being somewhat acceptable.

 - Blaze damage from 16-2 to 12-2
 - Fireball damage from 12-2 to 7-4 (better ranged damage, but much worse RPG potential)
 
General idea is that this unit has less raw damage than Blazer, but giving a 4 fire strikes at ranged if owning one of these. Thing that
in very specific cases is more convenient than Blazer's 11-3 fireballs.

Miasmist
 - Health from 46 to 48
 - Miasma damage from 7-3 to 6-3
 - XP from 74 to 82
 
Gas Baron
 - Miasma damage from 9-4 to 8-4
 - Price from 57g to 55g
 
Marshall price from 29g to 34g
Both marskman mele and +leadership aura in one unit.
 
Triggerman / Gunner / Artillery
 - Fire/Cold resistances from -10% to 0%
 - Gunner health from 47 to 48
 - Gunner price from 34g to 33g
 - Artillery Price from 63g to 57g
 
Wanderer
 - Fire resistance from -10% to -15%
 - Unwalkable defense from 60% to 0%
 
Rambler
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - XP from 80 to 86
 - Fire resistance from -10% to -15%
 - Unwalkable defense from 60% to 0%
 - Price from 30g to 32g
 
Itinerant
 - Movement from 7 to 5
 - Fire resistance from -10% to -15%
 - Unwalkable movement cost from 3 to 99
 - Unwalkable defense from 60% to 0%
 - Price from 51g to 53g
 
Steel Eagle
 - Health from 39 to 42
 - NEW ATTACK: Clockwork gun 7-1 pierce mele
 - Clockwork gun damage from 5-7 to 4-6
 - Fire resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Price from 25g to 32g
 
In a later review, will have a better look to wooden birds and steel eagles, just giving to lv2 a mele and decreasing the absurd potential
of 5-7 with 9 movement, but, stabilizing unit's survivavility

FEUDAL - Orcish Knagates
Buffs, this faction is actually seriously impopular because of being underpowered, even with my reworks.

Hunter 
 - Health from 26 to 28
 - Swallow Water defense from 20% to 30%
 - Mountains defense from 50% to 60%
 (swamp defense should be 40% but actually is 30% , if possible find to fix that)
 
Striker 
Important thing of this unit is that as gobling, can adquire negative traits 
(specially -1 mele damage per strike... which with backstab hits seriously hard... needs buffs)
 - Knife (mele) attack will now have +First-strike (which is now explained by a modification in unit description)
 - Swallow Water defense from 20% to 30%
 - Mountains defense from 50% to 60%
 (swamp defense should be 40% but actually is 30% , if possible find to fix that)
 - Price from 22g to 24g
 
Flanker
 - Swallow Water defense from 20% to 30%
 - Mountains defense from 50% to 60%
 (swamp defense should be 40% but actually is 30% , if possible find to fix that)

Icewind Herder

 - XP from 50 to 49
 
Outcast

Shieldbearer
 - Shieldbash damage from 9-1 to 5-2
 - Castle defense from 60% to 50%
 This unit will always do more damage in retaliation than in offensive, but always in attacks of the same amount of strikes.

Rigid
 - Shieldbash damage adjusted from 14-1 to 9-2
 - XP from 50 to 64
 - Castle defense from 60% to 50%
 XP increase is to make sure, this unit is not abusable in any game mode, by requiring the same amount of XP as of leveling up
 a normal unit. 
 
Stoic
 - The unit no longer has +Steadfast (Doesn't even need it, with lv3 upgrades of resistances)
 - NEW ATTACK: Kick 10-2 impact mele (this allow the unit to be somewhat useful on max level apart of being just a sponge of damage)
 - Shieldbash damage from 16-2 to 13-2 and no longer has +Slows special.
 - Castle defense from 60% to 50%
 - Price from 41g to 44g
 
Spearhead
 - Flail damage from 9-2 to 10-2
 - Impact resistance from 10% to 20% (bandaid fix to increase cost efficiency, will think later in something better)
 - XP from 40 to 43 
 - Price from 17g to 18g
 
Better a more expensive Spearhead, but a more notisable one.
 
Vanguard
 - Flail damage from 10-2 to 12-2 
 - Price from 36g to 34g
 
Khan
 - Flail damage from 13-2 to 15-2

Massif
 - Axe damage from 14-3 to 15-3
