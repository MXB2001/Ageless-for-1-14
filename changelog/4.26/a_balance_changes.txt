EE - Monsters
Monsters faction needs some rebalancing in certain units and builds. There must be a compesation of the +Marskman removal from dragon lines.
And in general, there is a tons of disbalances in that faction and some even in the side of underpowered...
Usually new players or players that are first time this faction have worse ressults than if the same players were using other faction...
Reasons are quite obvious, the roles aren't exactly the same as of most factions.

Little Spider / Spider / Overgrown spider
 - Forest defense from 30% to 40%
So at least they will benefit from being in forest tiles. Having the 40% defense that most units are used but at flat.

Wolf
This line is a blatant case of underpowered. Will increase their health.
 - Health from 28 to 32
 

Great Wolf
Some various buffs to make this unit be quite more useful.
 - Health from 40 to 42
 - Fangs damage from 5-4 to 6-4 and now has +Aimed (50% version of Marskman).
This will be consired as a balance test, making lv1 wolves boost higher level wolves's (50%) marskman.


Direwolf
 - Health from 52 to 55
 - Movement from 7 to 8
 - Fangs now has +Aimed (50% version of marskman)

Sneaky Tentacle
My apologies, but I'm lowering the cold resistance of this dead cuttlefish's spawn. On orocian gameplay dealing this unit with magical
cold attackers is quite painful. Just increasing relative damage taken by +50%.
 - Cold resistance from 60% to 40%

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Imperial - Lavinian Legion

Field Ballista
 - Health from 36 to 39
 - Ballista damage from 18-2 to 19-2
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Cold resistance from -20% to -10%
3 movement really sucks, this unit deserves some considerations at being that slow...
Has mele to defend himself from berserk, but losses steadfast and 1 movement point which both facts are significant.

Archuballistarius

 - Ballista damage from 24-2 to 25-2
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Cold resistance from -20% to -10%

Signifier

This one unit is more support rather than fighter even if this can accomplish the role of fighter as well.
 
Aquilifer
 - Health from 54 to 56
 - Price from 40g to 50g
Worth making more significant leveling up to Aquilifer. After all, before the nerf/buffs this unit gain +0 HP on lv3.

Feudal - Clockwork dwarves

 - Price from 57g to 54g
 
He's tankier (specially to physical damage) and heals+8 compared to blazer, seems fair.

Marshal Price from 29g to 34g

Much is that this unit IS 40% flat defense !!

 - XP from 50 to 55
 
Stoic
 - Shield no longer has slow on mele nor defense only!

16-2 is a quite decent attack for a lv3 tank, will see later if this needsa to be lowered or not, but slows but unable to attack
are details that both needs to be fixed

 - Price from 36g to 34g

Spearman
 - NEW ATTACK: Javelin 6-1 pierce ranged (same as lv1 spearmen from various factions)

EE - Enchanters
Some small fixes.

Floating Sword 
 - Health from 23 to 24 as compensation of the previous nerf of their resistances
 
Magic Sword's Health from 27 to 28

Shifting Sword
Underrated or not, I'm going to slightly nerfing it.
 - Movement from 7 to 6

Rune Purist
This unit needs a ceratain nerf, my fix is nerfing CTH (chance to hit) to make it scale fewer from upcoming damage and strikes upgrades.
 - Light rune damage from 2-10 to 3-10 and now is +Enchanted (always 60%) instead of +Magical.
 
This will not change that much this unit's effectiveness in normal gameplay but makes its upgrades less abusable.
 
Arcane Rune Transcriber
 - Light rune damage adjusted from 3-7 to 7-4 in order to scale worse with upgrades.
 - Fireball damage from 7-4 to 5-4 (still looks weird to me that this unit has fireballs... left to lv1 fireball dmg)
Weird , arcane rune transcriber had as name "arcane" in his name but his main attack used to be the fireballs... still maintaining fireballs.
Awful the ending of this unit, but the previous way this unit was being seemed akward to me.

Arcane Rune Splicer 
 - Health from 48 to 52
 - Chisel damage from 9-1 to 10-1
 - Light rune damage adjusted from 5-7 to 7-5
 
Rune Splicer
 - Ice rune is now +Enchanted instead of +Magical
 - Water rune is now +Enchanted instead of +Magical
Better to stop the combination of +Magical and +Slow in both attacks of this unit, apart of having somewhat good damage, can slow as well.

Runemage
 - Light rune damage adjusted from 4-8 to 5-6
 
Runemaster 
 - Light rune damage from 5-10 to 6-8
 - Ice rune damage from 10-5 to 9-5
