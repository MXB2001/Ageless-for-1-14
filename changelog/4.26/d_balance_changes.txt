ARCHAIC - Ancient Phantom
This is mostly a mummy bandaid fix. Mummy spam is inevitable... and ensuring that mummy spam be strongly hit with these nerfs. 
A faction is about USING a BUILD to have proper results NOT ABOUT SPAMMING a single line.

Mummy
Fixing bug at resistances
 - Pierce/Impact resistances adjusted from -10% to +10% as expected and wanted.

Milenium - Forest Keepers
Few readjustments, once again, of things that can be done even better of precious balance proposals.

Noticing that whole faction is weak to arcane attack types, which means that agianist specific matchups of ageless, this faction losses
except if overplaying the opponent ...

Sprite / Faerie 
 - Arcane resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Faerie Price from 42g to 40g
 
Sylvan Angel
 - Arcane resistance from -10% to +10%
 - Forest defense from 60% to 70% (same values as of lv1-lv2)
 
Underbush Faerie
This unit's magical weakness aren't fair or atleast aren't with the previous nerfs of mine... let's counter-nerf.
 - Fire/Cold resistances from -10% to 0%
 
Shadow Faerie
Looking that actually this unit is somewhat low in dmgs, but with too abusable RPG potential. No modifications at the moment only pricement.
 - Price from 46g to 40g
 
Nightwood Faerie
 - Forest Chill damage from 13-2 to 15-2 (it's just absurd that it only adquires +1 dmg on that attack on lv3)
 
Apart that with this attack's buffs, the unit itself is weaker than it used to be, just taht only stronger forest chill attack.
You're free to read AE 4.25 (b) balance changes to compare.

Keeper 
 - Health from 34 to 36

Sylvan Guardian
Concerning to the somewhat hard nerf to this unit, seems fair a XP buff to make lv3 be obtainable quicker.
 - XP from 110 to 100
 - Price from 42g to 37g
 
Assaliant / Dauntless / Vengance
 - Arcane resistance from -20% to -15% (I'ma try it, afterall, no arcane resistant units in the faction after sylvan guardian/god nerf)
 - Blade resistance from 5% to 6% (to really help them absorb 1 less damage at strikes of 9 or more dmg)
 - Fire resistance from -35% to -30% (for all level, as new value of lv3)
 (standarization of fire weakness of -30% for all assaliant and level ups)

 - Vengance movement from 5 to 6 
 - Vengance's price from 47g to 51g

Wouldn't agree at lowering arcane resistance in assaliant without testing them, but factional weaknesses are obvious, there are no
unit that are tought to arcane attacks at all, so helping the no regen assaliant to take a little less damage seems harmless to be tried.

Thorn Withc
 - Health from 27 to 28
 - XP from 41 to 40
 - Village defense from 60% to 50% (same as flat)
Not all factions have access to fire/arcane magical.

Thorn Fury
 - Health from 37 to 38
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - Village defense from 60% to 50% (same as flat)
 
Combines certain movility with tankyness and linebreaking potential, too much in a single unit.
Apart that is only vulnerable to fire/arcane magical attacks because of it's higher than usual defenses.
In case you don't have either fire/arcane attacks and specially if not magical, this unit causes a tons of havoc.
Not all factions have fire/arcane magical attackers.

Sylvan Wrath 
 - Health from 47 to 48
 - Thorn damage from 9-6 to 8-6
 - Village defense from 60% to 50% (same as flat)
Added this unit a 3-2 mele +first strike that can be upgraded in survivals, seems fair decreasing 1 dmg per ranged strike.

Elder Bark 
 - Crush damage from 16-2 to 15-2
 - Rock damage from 12-1 to 10-1 (to be exactly between lv1 and lv3 ranged)
This line gets resistances upgrades while leveing up, reason why lowered -1 mele damage to lv2 and lve3

Sentry Bark 
 - Crush damage from 21-2 to 20-2
