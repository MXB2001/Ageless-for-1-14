ARCHAIC - Menagerie
Some corrections that can consider proper to try.

Blue Novice
 - Fire resistance from 0% to 10%
Harmless buff? I guess.

Lunar Goo
Implementing some changes.
 - Psudopod damage from 3-3 to 4-2 (lowers chance to poison enemies)
 - Impact resistance from 45% to 55% (fixing wrong pending values)
Actual problem of Lunar Goo is that you can gain this unit from Lesser Assimilation. And it's only 6g unit.

Lunar Eye
 - Psudopod damage from 4-3 to 6-2
 
Lunar Stinkbug 
 - Stench damage from 7-2 to 6-2

Manbot
 - Spark damage from 4-1 to 5-1
 - Price from 8g to 9g
 
Mechanical Sentinel
 - Spark (ranged) is now +Aimed instead of +Skilled special.
Nerfing its marskman to Aimed (50% marskman) instead of +Skilled is a change that now occurs as the wanted way.
Previosuly, IPS said about nerfing it's marksman instead of a complete special removal.

ARCHAIC - Primevalists
Oh oh! this only means some nerfs. Usually not much skill is required to notice how this faction is considerably superior than many
others. These chaneges shouldn't harm that much skilled Primevalist players, but harms frecuent misstakes at not having a proper
distribution of damage taken.

Most common nerfs will be decreasing Lv1 regeneration and general XP increase to level up to the blue skinned. Apart of some important
adjustments.

Cutter
 - Regenerates+8 is now Regenerates+6 !!
 - XP from 34 to 41
 
Iron Wheel
 - Fist damage from 7-2 to 6-2
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -25%
 - Blade resistance from 20% to 10%
 - XP from 70 to 86
 - Price from 30 to 32
 
Aerowheel
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -20%
 - Cold resistance from 40% to 25%
 - Blade resistance from 30% to 20%
 - Impact resistance from 20% to 10%
 - Price from 50 to 57
 
Sunwheel
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -15%
 - Blade resistance from 30% to 20%
 - Impact resistance from 30% to 20%
 - Cold resistance from 40% to 30%
 - Fire resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Price from 50 to 75
 
Firewheel
 - Movement from 7 to 6
 - Fire resitance from 50% to 40%
 - Firewheel attack special is now +Enchanted (always 60% hit) instead of +Magical
 - Price from 50 to 57
With these nerfs we're done with this unit for now. Notice that 14-4 is still brutal which at night is 17-4 !

Swiftfoot
 - Health from 35 to 34
 - Regenerates+8 is now Regenerates+6 !!
 - XP from 38 to 41
 
Escort
We're following first the Scort advancement, which is the Overpowered one. While buffing the other choice to be a viable option.
 - Glaive damage from 11-3 to 10-3 but still maintains first-strike.
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -25%
 - Blade/Pierce resistance from 30% to 20%
 - Impact resistance from 20% to 10%
 - XP from 66 to 86
 - Price from 28 to 32
 
Protector
 - Arcane from -30% to -20%
 - Blade/Impact resistances from 30% to 25%
 - Pierce resistance from 40% to 25%
 - XP from 105 to 115
 - Price from 50 to 55
 
Highguard
 - Arcane from -30% to -15%
 - Blade/Impact resistance from 40% to 30%
 - Pierce resistance from 50% to 40%
 
Striker
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -25%

 - Price from 25 to 28
 - XP from 70 to 77
 - Price from 25 to 28

Gyrestriker
 - Flail damage from 13-4 to 10-5
 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -20%
 - Blade resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Price from 40g to 52g

Slowfoot
 - Regenerates+8 is now Regenerates+6 !!
 - XP from 39 to 50
Hitting both XP and regen might be enough for now to decrease this unit's cost efficiency.

Driver
 - Chain damage from 11-3 to 10-3
 - XP from 60 to 86
 - Price from 25 to 30
 
LineBreaker
 - Price from 50 to 55
 
Dogface
 - XP fro 65 to 80
 - Price from 25 to 28
 
Warrior
 - Axe damage from 17-2 to 18-2
 - Impact resistance from 30% to 20%
 - Pierce resistance from 10% to 0%
 - XP from 131 to 142
 - Price from 70 to 55
 
Titan
 - Axe damage from 20-2 to 22-2
 - Pierce resistance from 20% to 10%
Judging fairly, this unit has mele damage of a lv3 but with first strike and marskman. The extra damage looks harmless to add 
considering it now requires more XP to adquire Titan.

Velite
Cheap regen unit, well used this unit is helpful. But let's make it more easy to use its advantage.
 - Health from 28 to 30
 - Regenerates+8 is now Regenerates+6 !! 
 - Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - XP from 40 to 46
 
Hastate
 - Impact resistance from 10% to 0%
 - Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - XP from 80 to 86
 - Price from 26 to 28
 
Peltast
 - Health from 48 to 53
 - Blade/Impact resistance from 30% to 20%
 - Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Price from 46 to 54
 
Primevalist Fighter
 - Darts damage from 4-3 to 2-3
The underrated Zealous Primevalist spam. Upkeepless spam anti-abuse.

Primevalist Fanatic
 - Darts damage from 7-3 to 4-3
 - Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
With certain amount of upgrades, this unit was viable to use at both mele and ranged. Considering that Zealous makes upkeep=0 no matter
the unit level. I see no problem giving it some extra tankyness for the loss of 40% of its ranged damage.

Primevalist Brigthield
This unit is VERY abusable in RPG games, specially in games in which you can just buy a weapon to counter his low base damage. Decreasing
resistances but lowering required XP to lv3.
 - Arcane resistance from 50% to 40%
 - Fire/Cold resistance from 40% to 20%
 - XP from 100 to 90
 - Price from 25 to 28
 
Primevalist Sun-shield
 - Sword damage from 12-3 to 10-3
 - Arcane resistance from 60% to 50%
 - Fire/Cold resistances from 50% to 35%
 - Price from 45 to 52
Looks fair to me that this somewhat resistant slowfoot tank to have lv2 mele damage. Still his base health is just absurd lol.
Will soon see if this unit still needs more nerfs to prevent certain abuses.

Primevalist Leader
 - Soul Pierce damage from 8-3 to 6-3
 - Blade resistance from 10% to 20%
 
Primevalist Monk
 - Staff damage from 7-2 to 6-2
 - Price from 28 to 34
 
Primevalist Prior
 - Base Staff damage from 6-2 to 7-2
 - Price from 35 to 52

ME - Hive
Some various changes to Hive to make them more balanced and dynamic to use.

Soldier Ant
 - Pierce/Blade resistances from 30% to 25%
 - Sting damage from 11-2 to 10-2
 
Bull Ant
 - Bite damage from 13-4 to 12-4
 - Sting damage from 22-2 to 19-2
 - Price from 46 to 52

Fire Ant
 - Sting damage from 13-2 to 11-2
I see no problem nerfing its sting considering this unit can poison at both mele and ranged.

Stag/Hercules
 - Fire resistance from 20% to 15%
This unit originally did not have fire resistance (it was even weak to fire?), dunno, but lowered this to decrease steadfast's bonus
to something that the unit did not have originally.

Lantern Bug
 - Tackle damage from 7-4 to 6-4
 - Flash has now +Aimed (50% version of marskman)
 - Impact resistance from -30% to -25%
 - Arcane resistance from 20% to 30%
 - Fire resistance from 70% to 60%
 
Drone
 - Sting damage from 9-2 to 8-2
 - Arcane/Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Impact resistance from 0% to -10%
I do personally dislike that certain units have only -20% or larger weaknesses.

Prince
 - Sting damage from 14-2 to 12-2
 - Arcane/Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Impact resistance from 0% to -10%
It's leadership unit that can poison, doesn't need to have normal output of damage. This specially nerfs starting with this unit as leader.
 
Regal
 - Sting damage from 14-3 to 12-3
 - Sting damage from 14-2 to 12-2
 - Arcane/Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Impact resistance from 0% to -10%
 - Price from 46 to 52
 
Wasp
 - Health from 55 to 52
 - Sting damage from 9-3 to 8-3
 - Impact resistance from -10% to -15%
 - XP from 82 to 75
Underrated unit that is pretty strong, 1 MP cost everywhere and 60% defense everywhere (just 40% at villages)

Hornet
 - Sting damage from 15-3 to 13-3 but now has +Frist-Strike
 - Bite damage from 10-5 to 9-5
 - Fire resistance from -20% to -15%
 - Price from 46 to 52
 
Queen
 - Sting damage from 16-1 to 13-1
 - Infect damage from 10-2 to 8-2
 - Will now regen +2 per turn.
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Flat defense from 30% to 40%
 
Overmind
 - Sting damage from 26-1 to 19-1
 - Infect damage from 11-3 to 9-3
 - Will now regen +3 per turn
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Flat defense from 30% to 40%
 - Price from 48 to 55

Gnat
Actually Gnat is a somewhat abusable unit, specially in lv1. These few nerfs doesn't affect its viality as unit and prevents abuses.
 - Bother Damage from 2-5 to 2-4
 - Fire resistance from 20% to 10%

Fly
The most nerfed of the Gnat advancement, it has really good reasons to be like this.
 - Bother damage from 2-8 to 2-6
 - Movement from 10 to 8
 - Fire resistance from 20% to 10%
Before an adjustment, Fly used to have -50% fire resistance (loosing 70% fire resistance when in lv1) but it was changed.
This version of Fly maintains most of its strengths and prevents some abuses.

Mosquito
 - Fire resistance from 20% to 10%
 
Hopper
 - Trackle damage from 10-2 to 9-2
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 
Skipper
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Trackle damage from 10-3 to 9-3
 - Charge damage from 20-1 to 10-2 (less abusable in RPG)

Glider
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Swamp defense from 40% to 50%
 - Frozen movement cost from 1 to 2
 - Swamp movement cost from 1 to 2
 - Frozen defense from 30% to 40%
 - Price from 40 to 38
 
Mantis
I would like to do some reworks to this unit.
 - Health from 58 to 53
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - Scyche now has +First-Strike and +Aimed (50% marskman)
 - Pierce resistance from 60% to 45%
 - Blade resistance from 50% to 35%
 - Arcane resistance from 0% to 10%
 - Cold resistance from 0% to -5%
 - Forest movement cost from 3 to 1
 - Forest defense from 40% to 50% 
 - Hills defense from 50% to 40%
 - Mountain defense from 60% to 50%
 - Price from 27 to 28
 
With these changes, Mantis is a somewhat viable forest tiles defender line that cannot have 60% defense in any terrain and that offensively
is more interesting than pre-reworked mantis that was a weird 40% flat defense tank.

Termite
Now aditionally will have a weak an optional 2 strikes ranged.
 - NEW ATTACK: Acid Spray 5-2 fire ranged
 - Price from 17g to 18g
This will help termite last hit better. No need to implement this attack on lv2 ones.
 
Spider
This unit's cost efficiency is just absurd. Let's decrease movement by 1.
 - Movement from 6 to 5
Spider recived a impact resistance improvement while leveing up, making them better defenders on higher levels. Now it's their turn
to take their counter-nerf.
 
Tarantula
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - Price from 30g to 33g
 
Gargantuar
 - Movement from 6 to 5
 - Web damage from 7-5 to 6-5
 - Price from 48g to 53g
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

ME - Oracles 

Arbiter/theurgist/judgmentor
Actually fixing a bug that their new blade attack is not applying because of being arcane type too.
 - Arbiter's Sword 8-2 is now blade type
 - Theurgist's Sword 8-3 is now blade type
 - Judgmentor's Sword 11-3 is now blade type
After the changes are implemented, will check if this line needs a counter nerf due to their new optional attack type.
