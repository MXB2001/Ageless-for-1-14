ARCHAIC - Despair
Lookslike that spearmen are much less popular than widows, but every despair army needs spearmen. Let's do some adjustments to the faction.

The faction had an important problem: no efficient blade, arcane or fire attackers, which is an important problem of balance when this faction 
is fighting versus heavy walking trees like wose or others. My bandaid to this was adding an optional blade attack to spearmen.

 - Arcane resistance from -30% to -20%

Faction doesn't have blade attackers on lv1, this might help a bit.

ARCHAI - Ancient Phantom
This is mostly a mummy bandaid fix. Mummy spam is inevitable... and ensuring that mummy spam be strongly hit with these nerfs. 
A faction is about USING a BUILD to have proper results NOT ABOUT SPAMMING a single line.

Mummy
According to https://units.wesnoth.org/1.12/Ageless_Era/en_US/AE_mrc_oracles_Disciple.html which is a somewhat expensive but cost efficient
lv0, Mummy is MUCH but MUCH better than how has to be !! Some things will occur to mummy line to harm somewhat hard to players that just 
finds fun spamming a single line.
 - Curse has now -Enchanted (always 60% hit chance) instead of +Magical
 - Blade resistance from 10% to 0%
 - Pierce/Impact resistances from 20% to 10%
 - Fire/Arcane resistance from -25% to -35%
 - Cold resistance from 0% to -5%
 - Forest/Hill/Swamp/Fungus movement costs from 1 to 2 
 - Forest/Hill/Fungus defense from 60% to 50%
 - [WANTED] Swamp movement costs from 1 to 2(Swamp defense might be actually 1, was like that but was not working wat)
 - [MENTION] mountain defense is now 50% as wanted [mountain=50] instead of [mountains=50] was making this modification to not work.
             Basically for this, must be considered the Terrain modifier's table name to adjust correctly the changes.
 - Swallow water movement cost from 3 to 2
 - XP from 20 to 25
 - Price fro 11g to 12g
 
Shouldn't be that cost efficient maintaining this unit at lv0 ... quite expensive but afterall is a very bulky mage.
Decided to decrease hit chance instead of raw damage. Decreasing cth decreases upcoming damage upgrades. Lv1 and other level ups
are magical on ranged.
 
Mummy Unbound
 - Blade resistance from 10% to 6%
 - Pierce/Impact resistances from 20% to 15%
 - Fire/Arcane resistance from -25% to -30%

             Basically for this, must be considered the Terrain modifier's table name to adjust correctly the changes.

 - Swallow water movement cost from 3 to 2

EOC - Chaos
An huge nerf to a specific unit that its special is VERY abusable in any game mode.

Demonshapeshifter
 - Blade/Pierce/Impact/Fire/Cold resistance from 0% to -13%
 
This is an important nerf, this unit basically heals half of damage taken if it's not arcane type. Not all factions have arcane attackers,
but this allow the smart use of heavy strikes units to last hit Demonshapeshifter because if the damage taken is lethal there is no healing.
Favoring at most these heavy 1-2 strikes units that commonly have problems at hitting 50-70% defense targets.

Lv2 is not meant to be tankier than some lv3 fighters...

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

EoF - Welking
Slight nerfs to Guardian of Sun and Luna's protector advancements. As well some buffs to Sage level ups.

Guardian of Sun
 - Sunburst damage from 6-2 to 5-2
Imagine having 5-4 impact mele and aditionally 6-2 fire on ranged. Remember that many ranged are 18 dmg while this mele was 12 on ranged...
For now I'm trying a soft nerf of only 1 ranged damage instead of the originally planned of 4-2.

Golden Guard
 - Sunburst damage from 6-4 to 6-3
Can be tried, still being 28 dmg on mele and 20 on ranged is quite strong. 
Now balancing units is harder with the existence of both afterlife and Ageless union... 

Sentinel of moon
 - Pierce/Blade resistance from 20% to 17% (40% --> 34% during steadfast).
 
This unit starts taking +1 damage at strikes of 7 or higher damage or +2 damage per strike at hira of 36 of higher damage while defending.
While attacking, this unit takes +1 damage at strikes of 14 exaact damage and from 18 or above damage. 
+2 Dmg taken per strike starts at 50 and some other values higher than that.
Reasons are quite obvious, there is no defense handicap for having this steadfast nor in damage. 

This unit now needs of atleast x2 upgrades of resistances in orocia to have perfect 50% at pierce/blade, in case of taking only 1 might
be 22% (44% while defending). This nerf is not intended for Lv3; this is intended to hit players that prefer mantaining units at lower
levels in afterlife and orocian gameplay.

Elder Sage
 - Staff damage from 3-2 to 5-2
 - Price from 30g to 34g
Countering certain overnerf done to this unit somewhat long ago.

Doyen
 - Staff damage from 4-2 to 6-2
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 15%
 - Price from 49 to 55
Resistances buffs is to reward better people who decides to level up their units naturally instead of the use of XP mod.

Patriarch
 - Staff damage from 4-2 to 8-2
 - Cold resistance from 0% to 25%
Making its stats be more rightful for lv4.

Battle Sage
 - Now will regen(+2) per turn!
 - Fire/Cold resistances from 0% to 10%
 - Arcane resistance from 20% to 25%
Reasons of this unit being impopular are blatant, loosing healing+8 from lv1 to only +4 to alied. 
Srill, levelin strong sages into this option is a quite strong 6-5 blade mele option. 

Battle Seer
 - Will now regen(+2) per turn!
 - Will now cure from poison itself! (will be the same if next to Sage or if standing in village)
 - Fire/Cold resistances from 0% to 15%
 - Arcane resistance from 20% to 30%
 - Moonbean is now +Aimed (50% version of marskman) 
 
This unit quite looses magical at ranged (6-2 +magical to 7-3 but specialess which will be now +Aimed) and its healing+4.
Allowing itself to cure from poison gives it pretty interesting properties while in frontline.

Now you will get a somewhat decent mele fighter if you go for this instead of having another healing+8 sage.
Will now recive 10-4 damage from 12-4 fire/cold rangeed magical. 
As always, buffing units that have good reasons to be impopular.

EOC - Sylvans
Some favorable adjustments to Sylvans gameplay.

Elvish Acolyte
 - NEW ATTACK: gossamer 3-2 impact ranged +slows
 
Looks like an important improvement, just that any Acolyte that desides to use slow ranged is a Acolyte that will not use 7-3 arcane magical.
But this kinda help at certain situations, specially at survival maps in which Lv1 acolytes damage can be sacrificed for slows.
Still, it costs 2g more than shaman and decreases your in turn damage dealt to attempt to slow an enemy unit.
With the slows, it will help these elves to deal with the fact of not having healing+4 shamans but a pair of lines with cures.

Ascetic
 - gossamer damage from 8-2 to 7-2

Sprite
 - XP from 40 to 48
 - Now has +Cures (heals from poison to alied units)
These elves unlike rebels, they don't have an early healing unit nor anything that allows them to slow.

Fire Faerie / 
 - Now have +Cures (heals from poison to alied units)
 
Warrior Spirit
 - NEW ATTACK: Wail 2-2 cold ranged (with its animations!)
 
Considered a buff to this unit because it will never heal +2 per hit at units like human race. Also, it depends of being in forest tiles
to have its sustain.

Milenium - Forest Keepers
Adjustment to milenium factions. New era which was not revised by me before.

Still, I kinda liked the treefolks stats, later will ensure making them more balaned and fun to use. For now, faerie nerfs and
treefolk buff as compesation. Will test them a lot later in various game modes to ensure a fine balance in this faction, 
their concept is really interesting just that it wasn't properly executed.


Sylvan Wyvern
 - Cry damage from 7-2 to 5-2
Reason is that this unit moves 9, has 7-3 blade and is too much to ask to have a 7-2 cold (9-2 at daytime) which is strong as well. 

Nighthood Wyvern
 - Movement from 10 to 9
 - Cry damage from 8-3 to 6-3
 - Price from 40g to 37g
For now will try this moderate nerf. This unit is a bit too hard to kill with only lv1 because of having strong mele and ranged...

Sprite 
 - Health from 25 to 24
 - Cold resistance from -10% to 0%
 - XP from 40 to 48
 - Price from 18g to 20g

Faerie

Shadow Faerie 
 - Health from 49 to 40
 - Faerie touch damage from 8-2 to 6-2
 - Forest chill damage from 11-2 to 12-2
 - Fire/Cold resistance from -10% to 0% 
 - XP from 80 to 90 
 
Nightwood faerie
 - Health from 62 to 53
 - Faerie touch damage from 9-2 to 8-2
 - forest chill damage from 13-2 to 14-2
 - Fire/Cold resistance from -10% to 0%
 - Price from 80 to 60
 
Assailant / Dauntless / Vengance
 - Blade resistance from 0% to 5%
 - Fire resistance from -40% to -35% (-30% for vengance)
 - Castle defense from 30% to 40% (attempt of making them somewhat considerable in orocia)
 - Mountain movement cost from 3 to 2 (still 40% defense)
This allow them to take 1 less damage per strike from blade strikes with 9 damage or more.
They don't regen unlike Bark guise, so they depend of being next to a guardian to heal from poison or from damage.

Bark Guise and advancements
 - Castle defense from 30% to 40% (attempt of making them somewhat considerable in orocia)
 - Mountain movement cost from 3 to 2 (still 40% defense)

 - XP from 77 to 80
 
Sylvan Wrath
 - NEW ATTACK: Thorn 3-2 pierce mele +Defend-only +First-strike
 - Price from 43 to 52

MILENIUM - CENTAURS
Well... I'm viewing that defensively they're underpowered just that their offensive and movility are really nice. These concepts
are hardest to balance (other examples like this one are Marauders and Deep elves). Will not touch this without testing.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Hart Seeker
