Archaic - South seas
- Seaman line more tankier, but 8-2 impact instead of 10-2. More intended to be a tank role (41 HP with certain weaknesses). Optional 4-3 impact mele for better last hitting.
- Seaman advancement have better resistances and a little more health, while cheaper in era of heroes, lower damage but optional 6-3 impact + first strike for better last hitting.
- Swimmers increased survivavility, lower weaknesses, Lv1 now requires 1 MP cost at flat, higher health for lv2 and lv3 but one less movement. Standarized a little their backstab mele. Lowred damages of ranged, but at lv2 now their dmg is 7-2 instead of 14-1 for higher chances of slowing.
- Shoreman a trustable (kinda overpriced) 6-3 pierce mele (+1 mele) but weakned the optional slow impact mele. All their weaknesses got lowered to 0%.
- Lorecaster now 0% cold resistant but 10% weak to fire, +1g cost because of maintaining the 6-2 blade mele.
- Arsonists nerfs considering better cost efficiency at Swimmers/Shoremen and tankier Seamen.
- Breeze and advancement adjustments. Weaker magical res to decrease their RPG potential, aimed (marskman) on Lv1 and lv2 attacks with swarm, while lowered abusable potential (2-8 --> 2-7 for lv1 and 4-7 for lv2). Weaker mele at both. Lv0 breezes costs +1g because of matchup synergy with swimmers and shoremen backstab attacks.
- Albatros cost 16g --> 14g and easier to level up and a lot cheaper in era of heroes.
- Fariness repricing.

Archaic - Orcs
- Slingers now have much lower cold resistance to more realistic values.
- Rat riders tail attacks were nerfed, while lv2 and lv3 resistances lowered due too much tankyness.
- No orc is now 70% defense at castle and village, while some Knave advancement got lowered resistances to more fair values.
- Fireline torch and fire breath were lowered, but their axe damage deals more damage. Aditional 10% fire res at lv3.

- Fariness repricing, and accurately balanced job.

EoC - Summoners
- Fire imp now costs 14g (+1g) while being -10% arcane res on all levels, and lv1 is now 40% cold weak instead of 30%. Still maintaining their strong 10-2 fire mele status, only buff: 55% fire res at lv1/lv2. Lv2 is now 10% impact res (instead of 20%), while lv3 has only +10% fire res (60%) than before at the cost of -10% arcane res.
- Ethereal dragon/Serpetns now move -1 tile.
- Ice clubs now costs 1g less, and lv3 gains optional pierce mele in order to not lose their base pierce attack. Few extra health at all levels if I can remember fine.
- Vine leapers and advancement gain slightly better resistances and a little more health. Lv2 requires a little more XP to lv3.
- Shock birds +2 HP and +10% to fire/cold/arcane res from their previous values. Lv2 and Lv3 shock birds gain 50% Marskman on blade ranged attacks. Still a cost ineficient scouting unit that preffer trying this slight buff first.
- Sylph now moves 5 tiles on Lv1 and requires a little more XP to lv2.
- Undynes and advancements are now 30% impact resistant instead of 20%.
- Stone giant does a little less blade damage on lv3.
- Summoners
a) Lv2 (except summoner of air) loses 1 arcane damage on that one attack. Air summoner losses 1 movement. All summoners gain worse mele at lv2 and lv3 by not that much, still better values than in default mages. Lv3 summoners with no exception losses 1 arcane damage per strike.
b) Earth/water summoners now deal some more damage on their element ranged attack (specially lv3 water summoner at being now 9-3 +slow instead of 12-2, for higher chances of slowing). Fire master +1 fire ranged damage on their lv3. Decided that it's better to make summoners be more specialists in their elements instead of having a fairly good optional arcane ranged.
c) All summoners received certain movement costs improvement and/or defenses depending their elements, in order to make easier the use of their ressugerence special, decreasing handicaps on defense and sometimes in movement costs.
d) All elemental summoners and masters of elements received a description!
- Fairness repricing.

EoC - Quenoth Elves
- Hunters now are 5 movement which was added to archers that now are 6 movement.
- Improved general balance.
- Certain line of elves which is swift foot used to lose 1 ranged strike at poison attack, now as compesation they adquire 50% marskman to compesate the lost strike, which at Lv3 is a bonus that is adquired from investing such XP at leveling it. While the other option got nerfed their ranged.
- Various other misc stuff that I cannot remember well...
- Fairness repricing on all units of this faction.

MERCS - Avians
- Lv1 broadwing -1 mele damage per strike, and his advancement got some nerfs considering the advantages of +marskman in their attack (leadership lines do a little less ranged damage), while lv2 terror has a little less hp and lv3 dreadnought has -1 ranged damage on marskman and -2 on northwind.
- Mother and advancement now moves 5 tiles instead of 6 tiles. Still being a strong healer.

MERCS - Slavers
- Nerfs to harlots movement 6 --> 5 while made some of her movement costs be worse. Don't remember if now harder to lv1.
