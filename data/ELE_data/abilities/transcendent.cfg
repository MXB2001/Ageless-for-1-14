        description=_"This unit makes adjacent Fallen units feel like humans again. They gain 20% fire, 30% arcane, but loose their physical resistance so that they have human like resistence and loose 10% cold ressistance.
		
In case this aura is applied in any other alied unit
1) Arcane ressistance will get increased by 30% , fire will get increased by 20% 
2) Cold ressistance will get lowered by 10%
3) Physical ressistances will get lowered by 20%

It also have terrible consecuences when next to Fallen Tamers."
