Because it specialises on lesser forms of life, it may help a poisoned enemy, or the poison will protect it from the aura, taking only {POWER} hp. This ability ignores any resistances or weaknesses of enemies, so it`s very powerful against spirits. It never kills, because it always leaves 1hp at least. If the enemy is poisoned, it doesn't cumulate."
